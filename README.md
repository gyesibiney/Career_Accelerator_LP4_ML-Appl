### Installation for both  APPSâœ¨
run the attached command.txt file for both Apps

 ### ðŸ“š **Description**

this project involves deploying two graphical user interfaces with my best models in different projects. thus, deployment of Facebook prophet model on time series using Streamlit and deployment of logistic regression classifier using Gradio. as it follows below; 

### âœ¨ STREAMLIT APPP
# Developing a Streamlit web app for a time series model using Facebook Prophet 
## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a time series regression analysis model. I selected Facebook Prophet as my preferred model, utilizing external regressors and the built-in holiday effect feature of Facebook Prophet.

All necessary datasets and materials for this are available in my folders and files.



### Usage
Import all the required library names.

-To execute the application, use the command "streamlit run src/predict_page.py 
 to run the app utilizing the "predict_page.py" file.


### ðŸ“š **Description**
#### âœ¨ GRADIO APP
# Developing a Gradio web app for classification ML model for Vodafone Group
Basically, the aim of this project is to predict whether a customer will attrite using the web application(Gradio)


### Usage
- To execute Gradio use iface.launch()
